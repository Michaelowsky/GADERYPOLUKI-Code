# GADERYPOLUKI-Code
This code was made for university competition. My task was to make a funny IT/math game for teenagers. My idea was to use GADERYPOLUKI cipher used in Polish Scouting. 
First you need a key word, for example we can use GADERYPOLUKI as in title. Now we need a message we want to encrypt, let's take "CODE". 
Now we are changing every letter that exists in a key word to a letter beside. G - A, D - E, R - Y, P - O, L - U, K - I. So are encrypted message is "CPED".
To decrypt we just need to reverse this process.

Player in my game had only key word and encrypted message and was supposed to decrypt it on your own. My code only checked if he/she did it correctly.
